## About this homework

### Description (by Pirple)

#### Details:
Following the examples from the video lectures, create a simple "Hello World" mobile app (within Android Studio), and get it to run within one of the device-emulators. Don't worry about not-understanding the code yet, that's perfectly fine. For now, just copy the video as much as you need to, modifying it slightly to fit the functionality below.

#### Here's what your app's functionality should look like:
1. When you run the application, it should show a blank screen with a button that says "Press Me" (adding a header/top-nav is fine as well if you'd like one to be there)

2. When you press that button, the words "Hello World" should appear above the button.

After you've built your app, get it to run within one of the emulators (your choice of which device).
