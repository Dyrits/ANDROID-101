### Course
Pirple | Android 101 
Android Studio ~ Homework #3:  Collections

### Description (by Pirple)

#### Details:
 What is the difference between a list and an array? When would each be appropriate too use? In your own words, write 1 - 2 paragraphs explaining the different use-cases for each. If English is not your native language, feel free to write in whatever language you prefer. Just please note which language it is at the top of the assignment, so we know how to translate it.

Create a file called collections.kt and add your explanation as comments at the top of the page.

Then, within the document write 2 code examples (1 for lists, 1 for arrays) showcasing the use-cases you explained above

#### Extra Credit:
To earn extra credit, add an explanation of the word "mutable" to the top of your document. What does the word mean, and how does it apply to arrays and lists in Kotlin?
