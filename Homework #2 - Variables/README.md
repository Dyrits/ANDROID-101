# Song

## About this project

### Course
Pirple | Android 101 
Android Studio ~ Homework #2:  Variables

### Description (by Pirple)

#### Details:
What's your favorite song?

Think of all the attributes that you could use to describe that song. That is: all of it's details or "meta-data". These are attributes like "Artist", "Year Released", "Genre", "Duration", etc. Think of as many different characteristics as you can.

In your text editor, create an empty file and name it **song.kt**

Now, within that file, list all of the attributes of the song, (one after another on separate lines), by creating variables for each attribute, and giving each variable a value.

**Important**: Try to use as many different data types as you can!

Now, below your declarations, print the value of each variable to the console, one after another.

When you're done, push the file up to Github

#### Extra Credit:
By this far in the course you probably intuitively figured out how comments work. There are two types of comments:

Single line comments: They start with two forward slashes, like so

```kotlin
// I am a single-line comment
```

Multi-line comments: They begin with a forward-slash and an asterisk, and end with the same characters in the reverse order.

```kotlin
/*
I am a
Multi-line comment
*/
```

For extra credit, add comments to your code, that explain the different attributes. Also add a title to the top of your file explaining what the file is, and what it's for.
